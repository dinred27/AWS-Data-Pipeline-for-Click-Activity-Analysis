# AWS-Data-Pipeline-for-Click-Activity-Analysis
Scheduled batch data pipeline to transform raw click logs in a RDS instance.

I have created a S3 bucket that holds all my certifications with public access 'on' and access logging 'on'. Access points to these certificates are put on my resume. Whenever someone clicks on these links, a raw log is generated with their ip-address, timestamp, certificate accessed in the bucket.
